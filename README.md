When to use JavaScript const?
As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp




When to Use JavaScript var?
Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
